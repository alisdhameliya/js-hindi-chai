const name = "hitesh"
const repoCount = 50

// console.log(name + repoCount + " Value");  This syntax  is not use in real life ( this is bad way to write code)

//   ` ` --> called as back ticks . Currently this is used

console.log(`Hello my name is ${name} and my repo count is ${repoCount}`);  // this is called as String interpoletaion.


// Second way to declare the String 

const gameName = new String('pychology');
console.log(gameName.length)
